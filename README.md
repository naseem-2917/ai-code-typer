## ⚙️ Run Locally

This project uses **Vite** and **React** with **TypeScript**.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v18+)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/naseem-2917/ai-code-typer.git
    cd ai-code-typer
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set API Key (Crucial Step):**
    Create a file named **`.env.local`** in the root directory. This file is ignored by git to keep your key private. Add your key in the Vite-compatible format:
    ```
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🚀 Deployment & Security

This application is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** using a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

-   **Continuous Deployment:** Any changes pushed to the `main` branch trigger an automatic build and update of the live site.
-   **Secure API Key Management:** The Gemini API key is managed securely using **GitHub Secrets**. It is injected as an environment variable only during the build process on the remote server, ensuring the key is never exposed in the public repository or client-side code.
